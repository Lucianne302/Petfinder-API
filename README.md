# Welcome
[Petfinder.com](www.petfinder.com) is an online database of adoptable pets. They work with over 14,000 shelters, and have helped the adoption of over 25 million animals. Petfinder offers an API to developers that want to connect to their database.

In this tutorial we’ll make use of the Petfinder API with HTML, Javascript, AJAX, and JSONP.  It’ll help if you have some knowledge of Javascript. 

### Here’s what we’ll cover:
* What’s an API?
* Getting a Key
* Our HTML
* Our Script
* JSONP
* Navigating the Response

### Final product
We will build a form that takes a zip code, calls the Petfinder API, and returns the name, image, and location of a nearby adoptable cat.
